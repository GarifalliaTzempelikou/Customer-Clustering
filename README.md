# Customer Segmentation -Clustering
The purpose of this project is to perform unsupervised clustering for customer segmentation. To achieve this we did use dimensionality reduction followed by linkage and agglomerative clustering. Additionally, we did use both visuals and statistical methods (elbow and silhouette) to identify a cluster multiplicity.

# Customer Segmentation -Clustering
The purpose of this project is to perform unsupervised clustering for customer segmentation. To achieve this we did use dimensionality reduction followed by linkage and agglomerative clustering. Additionally, we did use both visuals and statistical methods (elbow and silhouette) to identify a cluster multiplicity.

# The main steps

## 1) Data cleaning
## 2) Data Visualization

## 3) Data Scaling
## 4) Dimentionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## 5) Hierarchical clustering - Scipy linkage()

## 6) Hierarchical clustering - Sklearn agglomerative()
## 7) K-means, optimal k with elbow method

### At the iterative plot above we can see the ratio of Distortion Score for different number of clusters. We choose the k = 2 because there the ratio starts to decease in a linear way (the Elbow).

### Examining the elbow technique and the silhouette score we decided that the best separation of our data is in two clusters.

## 8) Plotting the clusters

## 9) Insights about the cluster distribution

## 10) Conclusion

First cluster includes customers with low income ,so , low spending who are mainly young but have a big family to take care of. As a result, their low income doesn't allow them to satisfy the needs of a big family. They prefer the deal purchases because of their economic problems.

Second cluster includes customers with high income and high spending who are round 45 years old and have 0 or 1 kid. They don't need deal purchases and they spend a lot of money to several products.

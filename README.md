# Customer Segmentation -Clustering
The purpose of this project is to perform unsupervised clustering for customer segmentation. To achieve this we did use dimensionality reduction followed by linkage and agglomerative clustering. Additionally, we did use both visuals and statistical methods (elbow and silhouette) to identify a cluster multiplicity.

# The main steps

## 1) Data cleaning
## 2) Data Visualization

## 3) Data Scaling
## 4) Dimentionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## 6) Hierarchical clustering - Sklearn agglomerative()
## 7) K-means, optimal k with elbow method

### Examining the elbow technique and the silhouette score we decided that the best separation of our data is in three clusters.

## 8) Plotting the clusters

## 9) Insights about the cluster distribution

## 10) Conclusion

First cluster includes customers with high income and high spending who are >45 and have 0 or 1 kid. They don't need deal purchases and they spend a lot of money to several products.

Second cluster includes customers with average income and average spending. They don't seem to have economic problems but they don't live in abundance either.

Third cluster includes customers with low income ,and so, low spending who are mainly young but have a big family to take care of. As a result, their low income doesn't allow them to satisfy the needs of a big family. They prefer the deal purchases because of their economic problems.
